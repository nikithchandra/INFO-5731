1,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching.",ye deriv ye even moder familiar movi last decad think talent mr ripley fairli earli runtim howev part enjoy barri keoghan never disappoint whether play suicid dullard banshe inisherin psychot mastermind movi mani role alway brilliantfor unfortun third act probabl memor featur requir enorm suspens disbelief rosamund elspeth charact invit keoghan oliv charact home yet even though histori unbeliev dubiou claim felt guilti exil one wonder motiv tri sex point rosamund pike ageless gorgeou woman charact endless wealthsh didnt need averagelook poor guy life also sign away fortun quickli suspici sudden ill life butler observ everyth ob remain presenc even elspeth took leav sen wouldnt interced third act defi sort logicbut worth watch,Positive
2,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
3,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility. Too much, too brash, too over-the-top, too silly, too boring.Story not told well, whatever it was.

4,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do. Save your money, and don't waste your time on this vastly overrated release from a vastly overrated filmmaker.",sometim come across filmmak whose work dont like two featur honestli say writerdirector emerald fennel didnt care much debut outing promis young woman say followup effort saltburn alleg thriller seemingli awkward quietli sinist oxford student barri keoghan ingrati famili wealthi english aristocrat featur stori charact quit frankli couldnt care le think kill sacr deer cast eccentr old money croni wolf sheep cloth assemblag utterli reprehens charact live utterli reprehens live zealous adher utterli reprehens valu fail endang viewer empathi interest even connect much narr predict glacial pace incorpor sequenc includ littl forc shock valu featur monodimension blatantli obviou almost trite charact develop frequent stumbl attempt humor wedg larg sake conveni calculatedli time comic relief kind pictur prompt regular look one watch see much one must endur deliv welcom sigh relief end final come what given combin talent pool product genuin shame see like rosamund pike carey mulligan richard e grant releg support role abil sore underus there excess hammi perform keoghan who quit obvious knowingli act disappear bona fide portray charact offer feel like pictur tri aw hard see much get away especi seek invok drop jaw among audienc member much director cinemat predecessor attempt save money dont wast time vastli overr releas vastli overr filmmak,Positive
5,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive
6,"Take a bit of A Separate Peace, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Brideshead Revisited, Howards End and many more, mix them up into a rather incoherent story, and you get this over-the-top bit of fluff. The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
7,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

9,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
10,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

15,I had greater expectations of this film given the combined talent of the cast. There are some very good actors in it but I suppose if the plot is no good there is nothing much they can do to elevate to watchable. Quick frankly it is barely watchable. Some really bizarre events occur that are neither funny nor scary. Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters. None of the characters including the leads are likeable. The plot is explained at the end but to be honest it's not worth watching to find out.,greater expect film given combin talent cast good actor suppos plot good noth much elev watchabl quick frankli bare watchabl realli bizarr event occur neither funni scari bewild film seemingli real stori plot interact rather superfici charact none charact includ lead likeabl plot explain end honest worth watch find,Positive
16,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

It's bold, provocative and just so funny, buoyed by a cast who completely understand the assignment and deliver glorious results.Barry Keoghan gives a fearless performance, bearing all in more ways than one. His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise. The writer director seems to go for pruerient, lame attempts to shock, but nothing - NOTHING - is unexpected, nothing is surprising.And, there are no sympathetic characters at all.

19,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
20,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten. But it leaves a record of a decadent, nihilistic era that has been stripped of the basic values of humanity and civilization.",must observ saltburn vile disgust motion pictur charact unsympathet action abhorr bodili fluid flow throughout nauseat experienceth catton famili depict idl hedonist relic past deserv pick onebyon implic british aristocraci belong gutter beauti catton home includ detritu past shakespear first folio paint ruben discard along worn lord englandth middleclass also treat utter contempt young oliv appar asham famili inform friend father dead mother drunk parent proud son want lifeeven hallow hall univers oxford lost luster joy learn singl meet tutori even read book student read listthi film shortli forgotten leav record decad nihilist era strip basic valu human civil,Negative
21,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

23,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
24,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

25,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

26,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching.",ye deriv ye even moder familiar movi last decad think talent mr ripley fairli earli runtim howev part enjoy barri keoghan never disappoint whether play suicid dullard banshe inisherin psychot mastermind movi mani role alway brilliantfor unfortun third act probabl memor featur requir enorm suspens disbelief rosamund elspeth charact invit keoghan oliv charact home yet even though histori unbeliev dubiou claim felt guilti exil one wonder motiv tri sex point rosamund pike ageless gorgeou woman charact endless wealthsh didnt need averagelook poor guy life also sign away fortun quickli suspici sudden ill life butler observ everyth ob remain presenc even elspeth took leav sen wouldnt interced third act defi sort logicbut worth watch,Positive
27,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
28,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

29,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

30,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive
31,"Take a bit of A Separate Peace, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Brideshead Revisited, Howards End and many more, mix them up into a rather incoherent story, and you get this over-the-top bit of fluff. The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
32,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

34,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
35,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

41,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

44,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
45,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten. But it leaves a record of a decadent, nihilistic era that has been stripped of the basic values of humanity and civilization.",must observ saltburn vile disgust motion pictur charact unsympathet action abhorr bodili fluid flow throughout nauseat experienceth catton famili depict idl hedonist relic past deserv pick onebyon implic british aristocraci belong gutter beauti catton home includ detritu past shakespear first folio paint ruben discard along worn lord englandth middleclass also treat utter contempt young oliv appar asham famili inform friend father dead mother drunk parent proud son want lifeeven hallow hall univers oxford lost luster joy learn singl meet tutori even read book student read listthi film shortli forgotten leav record decad nihilist era strip basic valu human civil,Negative
46,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

48,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
49,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

50,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

51,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching.",ye deriv ye even moder familiar movi last decad think talent mr ripley fairli earli runtim howev part enjoy barri keoghan never disappoint whether play suicid dullard banshe inisherin psychot mastermind movi mani role alway brilliantfor unfortun third act probabl memor featur requir enorm suspens disbelief rosamund elspeth charact invit keoghan oliv charact home yet even though histori unbeliev dubiou claim felt guilti exil one wonder motiv tri sex point rosamund pike ageless gorgeou woman charact endless wealthsh didnt need averagelook poor guy life also sign away fortun quickli suspici sudden ill life butler observ everyth ob remain presenc even elspeth took leav sen wouldnt interced third act defi sort logicbut worth watch,Positive
52,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
53,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd.

54,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

55,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential.

57,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely.

59,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
60,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters.

66,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive
67,"Emerald Fennell leaps over any potential sophomore slumps with Saltburn, an immensely twisted tale of obsession and excess that's black comedy eventually goes into much darker territory. It's bold, provocative and just so funny, buoyed by a cast who completely understand the assignment and deliver glorious results.Barry Keoghan gives a fearless performance, bearing all in more ways than one. His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

69,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
70,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

71,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

73,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in.

74,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

75,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted. It's a solidly entertaining (if broadly unoriginal) little film, but as someone NOT from the world of Saltburn - it left a sour taste.",emerald fennel posh person she extraordinari wealth take noth away achiev filmmak promis young woman terrif difficult watch rightli laud go know come side moral disturb parabl troubl set one irk meth two obviou antagonist type peopl youd typic root film rich v poor fact turn head doesnt feel like innov step feel like exact opposit feel like someon enorm privileg tri redress balanc almost like propaganda pieceit beauti shot realli well act solidli entertain broadli unorigin littl film someon world saltburn left sour tast,Negative
76,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching.",ye deriv ye even moder familiar movi last decad think talent mr ripley fairli earli runtim howev part enjoy barri keoghan never disappoint whether play suicid dullard banshe inisherin psychot mastermind movi mani role alway brilliantfor unfortun third act probabl memor featur requir enorm suspens disbelief rosamund elspeth charact invit keoghan oliv charact home yet even though histori unbeliev dubiou claim felt guilti exil one wonder motiv tri sex point rosamund pike ageless gorgeou woman charact endless wealthsh didnt need averagelook poor guy life also sign away fortun quickli suspici sudden ill life butler observ everyth ob remain presenc even elspeth took leav sen wouldnt interced third act defi sort logicbut worth watch,Positive
77,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
78,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

79,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

80,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
82,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

84,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
85,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

90,I had greater expectations of this film given the combined talent of the cast. There are some very good actors in it but I suppose if the plot is no good there is nothing much they can do to elevate to watchable. Quick frankly it is barely watchable. Some really bizarre events occur that are neither funny nor scary. Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters. None of the characters including the leads are likeable.

91,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

94,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
95,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

96,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

98,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
99,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

100,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

101,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

102,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
103,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd.

104,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

105,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive
106,"Take a bit of A Separate Peace, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Brideshead Revisited, Howards End and many more, mix them up into a rather incoherent story, and you get this over-the-top bit of fluff. The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
107,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

109,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
110,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

116,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen.

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E.

118,"Baffled by the reviews here! This is a self-indulgent, unoriginal, poke in the eye, middle finger to the viewers piece of shallow trash.There are no interesting characters, no interesting events, no moments of insight, nothing whatsoever to make it worth one's time to watch this drivel.It is derivative of several other more original and thoughtful films & stories. There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise. The writer director seems to go for pruerient, lame attempts to shock, but nothing - NOTHING - is unexpected, nothing is surprising.And, there are no sympathetic characters at all. That can be OK on a well made - well written & well directed - film. But, this is not that film.This is shallow, ugly in spirit (because the writer/ director is deliberate in her meanness, callowness, shallowness and crude manipulation of viewers' generosity in given her (the director) their time and a level of confidence that they will be rewarded for watching.This is an absolute paper-thin crap movie, pretending to a higher-brow film.

119,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
120,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

121,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

123,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
124,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

125,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

126,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

127,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
128,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it.

He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd.

129,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

130,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

132,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

134,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
135,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

141,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

144,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does.

145,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

146,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared.

148,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
149,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

150,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

151,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching.",ye deriv ye even moder familiar movi last decad think talent mr ripley fairli earli runtim howev part enjoy barri keoghan never disappoint whether play suicid dullard banshe inisherin psychot mastermind movi mani role alway brilliantfor unfortun third act probabl memor featur requir enorm suspens disbelief rosamund elspeth charact invit keoghan oliv charact home yet even though histori unbeliev dubiou claim felt guilti exil one wonder motiv tri sex point rosamund pike ageless gorgeou woman charact endless wealthsh didnt need averagelook poor guy life also sign away fortun quickli suspici sudden ill life butler observ everyth ob remain presenc even elspeth took leav sen wouldnt interced third act defi sort logicbut worth watch,Positive
152,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
153,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

154,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

155,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart.

157,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

159,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
160,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

166,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

169,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does.

170,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

171,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

173,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
174,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

176,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
178,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

179,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

180,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive
181,"Take a bit of A Separate Peace, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Brideshead Revisited, Howards End and many more, mix them up into a rather incoherent story, and you get this over-the-top bit of fluff. The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
182,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

184,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
185,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

190,I had greater expectations of this film given the combined talent of the cast. There are some very good actors in it but I suppose if the plot is no good there is nothing much they can do to elevate to watchable. Quick frankly it is barely watchable. Some really bizarre events occur that are neither funny nor scary. Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters. None of the characters including the leads are likeable. The plot is explained at the end but to be honest it's not worth watching to find out.,greater expect film given combin talent cast good actor suppos plot good noth much elev watchabl quick frankli bare watchabl realli bizarr event occur neither funni scari bewild film seemingli real stori plot interact rather superfici charact none charact includ lead likeabl plot explain end honest worth watch find,Positive
191,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

194,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
195,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

196,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

198,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
199,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

200,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

201,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

202,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
203,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd.

204,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

205,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential.

206,"Take a bit of A Separate Peace, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Brideshead Revisited, Howards End and many more, mix them up into a rather incoherent story, and you get this over-the-top bit of fluff. The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
207,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

209,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
210,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

216,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

219,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this.

220,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten. But it leaves a record of a decadent, nihilistic era that has been stripped of the basic values of humanity and civilization.",must observ saltburn vile disgust motion pictur charact unsympathet action abhorr bodili fluid flow throughout nauseat experienceth catton famili depict idl hedonist relic past deserv pick onebyon implic british aristocraci belong gutter beauti catton home includ detritu past shakespear first folio paint ruben discard along worn lord englandth middleclass also treat utter contempt young oliv appar asham famili inform friend father dead mother drunk parent proud son want lifeeven hallow hall univers oxford lost luster joy learn singl meet tutori even read book student read listthi film shortli forgotten leav record decad nihilist era strip basic valu human civil,Negative
221,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

223,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
224,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

225,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

226,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

227,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
228,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd.

229,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

230,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

232,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely.

234,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
235,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters.

241,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

244,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does.

245,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

246,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

248,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
249,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

250,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted. It's a solidly entertaining (if broadly unoriginal) little film, but as someone NOT from the world of Saltburn - it left a sour taste.",emerald fennel posh person she extraordinari wealth take noth away achiev filmmak promis young woman terrif difficult watch rightli laud go know come side moral disturb parabl troubl set one irk meth two obviou antagonist type peopl youd typic root film rich v poor fact turn head doesnt feel like innov step feel like exact opposit feel like someon enorm privileg tri redress balanc almost like propaganda pieceit beauti shot realli well act solidli entertain broadli unorigin littl film someon world saltburn left sour tast,Negative
251,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching.",ye deriv ye even moder familiar movi last decad think talent mr ripley fairli earli runtim howev part enjoy barri keoghan never disappoint whether play suicid dullard banshe inisherin psychot mastermind movi mani role alway brilliantfor unfortun third act probabl memor featur requir enorm suspens disbelief rosamund elspeth charact invit keoghan oliv charact home yet even though histori unbeliev dubiou claim felt guilti exil one wonder motiv tri sex point rosamund pike ageless gorgeou woman charact endless wealthsh didnt need averagelook poor guy life also sign away fortun quickli suspici sudden ill life butler observ everyth ob remain presenc even elspeth took leav sen wouldnt interced third act defi sort logicbut worth watch,Positive
252,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
253,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

254,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

255,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart.

257,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

259,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes.

Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

There are some very good actors in it but I suppose if the plot is no good there is nothing much they can do to elevate to watchable. Quick frankly it is barely watchable. Some really bizarre events occur that are neither funny nor scary. Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters.

266,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

269,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
270,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

271,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

273,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
274,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

275,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

276,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

277,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave!

278,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

279,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

280,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
282,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

284,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
285,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

290,I had greater expectations of this film given the combined talent of the cast. There are some very good actors in it but I suppose if the plot is no good there is nothing much they can do to elevate to watchable. Quick frankly it is barely watchable. Some really bizarre events occur that are neither funny nor scary. Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters. None of the characters including the leads are likeable. The plot is explained at the end but to be honest it's not worth watching to find out.,greater expect film given combin talent cast good actor suppos plot good noth much elev watchabl quick frankli bare watchabl realli bizarr event occur neither funni scari bewild film seemingli real stori plot interact rather superfici charact none charact includ lead likeabl plot explain end honest worth watch find,Positive
291,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

It's bold, provocative and just so funny, buoyed by a cast who completely understand the assignment and deliver glorious results.Barry Keoghan gives a fearless performance, bearing all in more ways than one. His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

294,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
295,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

296,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

298,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
299,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

300,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative

This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right.

304,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

305,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential.

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
307,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

309,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
310,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

316,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

319,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this.

320,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten. But it leaves a record of a decadent, nihilistic era that has been stripped of the basic values of humanity and civilization.",must observ saltburn vile disgust motion pictur charact unsympathet action abhorr bodili fluid flow throughout nauseat experienceth catton famili depict idl hedonist relic past deserv pick onebyon implic british aristocraci belong gutter beauti catton home includ detritu past shakespear first folio paint ruben discard along worn lord englandth middleclass also treat utter contempt young oliv appar asham famili inform friend father dead mother drunk parent proud son want lifeeven hallow hall univers oxford lost luster joy learn singl meet tutori even read book student read listthi film shortli forgotten leav record decad nihilist era strip basic valu human civil,Negative
321,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

323,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
324,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

325,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

326,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

327,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
328,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it.

He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right.

329,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

330,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

332,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely.

334,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
335,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

341,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

344,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does.

345,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

346,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

348,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
349,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

350,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted. It's a solidly entertaining (if broadly unoriginal) little film, but as someone NOT from the world of Saltburn - it left a sour taste.",emerald fennel posh person she extraordinari wealth take noth away achiev filmmak promis young woman terrif difficult watch rightli laud go know come side moral disturb parabl troubl set one irk meth two obviou antagonist type peopl youd typic root film rich v poor fact turn head doesnt feel like innov step feel like exact opposit feel like someon enorm privileg tri redress balanc almost like propaganda pieceit beauti shot realli well act solidli entertain broadli unorigin littl film someon world saltburn left sour tast,Negative
351,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching.",ye deriv ye even moder familiar movi last decad think talent mr ripley fairli earli runtim howev part enjoy barri keoghan never disappoint whether play suicid dullard banshe inisherin psychot mastermind movi mani role alway brilliantfor unfortun third act probabl memor featur requir enorm suspens disbelief rosamund elspeth charact invit keoghan oliv charact home yet even though histori unbeliev dubiou claim felt guilti exil one wonder motiv tri sex point rosamund pike ageless gorgeou woman charact endless wealthsh didnt need averagelook poor guy life also sign away fortun quickli suspici sudden ill life butler observ everyth ob remain presenc even elspeth took leav sen wouldnt interced third act defi sort logicbut worth watch,Positive
352,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
353,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

354,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

355,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart.

357,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

359,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes.

Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

There are some very good actors in it but I suppose if the plot is no good there is nothing much they can do to elevate to watchable. Quick frankly it is barely watchable. Some really bizarre events occur that are neither funny nor scary. Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters.

366,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

369,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
370,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

371,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

373,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
374,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

375,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

376,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

377,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave!

378,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

379,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

380,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
382,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

384,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
385,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

390,I had greater expectations of this film given the combined talent of the cast. There are some very good actors in it but I suppose if the plot is no good there is nothing much they can do to elevate to watchable. Quick frankly it is barely watchable. Some really bizarre events occur that are neither funny nor scary. Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters. None of the characters including the leads are likeable. The plot is explained at the end but to be honest it's not worth watching to find out.,greater expect film given combin talent cast good actor suppos plot good noth much elev watchabl quick frankli bare watchabl realli bizarr event occur neither funni scari bewild film seemingli real stori plot interact rather superfici charact none charact includ lead likeabl plot explain end honest worth watch find,Positive
391,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

It's bold, provocative and just so funny, buoyed by a cast who completely understand the assignment and deliver glorious results.Barry Keoghan gives a fearless performance, bearing all in more ways than one. His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

394,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
395,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

396,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

398,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
399,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

400,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative

This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right.

404,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

405,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential.

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
407,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

409,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
410,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

416,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

419,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this.

420,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten. But it leaves a record of a decadent, nihilistic era that has been stripped of the basic values of humanity and civilization.",must observ saltburn vile disgust motion pictur charact unsympathet action abhorr bodili fluid flow throughout nauseat experienceth catton famili depict idl hedonist relic past deserv pick onebyon implic british aristocraci belong gutter beauti catton home includ detritu past shakespear first folio paint ruben discard along worn lord englandth middleclass also treat utter contempt young oliv appar asham famili inform friend father dead mother drunk parent proud son want lifeeven hallow hall univers oxford lost luster joy learn singl meet tutori even read book student read listthi film shortli forgotten leav record decad nihilist era strip basic valu human civil,Negative
421,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

423,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
424,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

425,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

426,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

427,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
428,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it.

He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd.

429,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

430,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

432,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely.

434,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
435,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

441,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

444,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does.

445,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

446,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

448,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
449,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

450,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted. It's a solidly entertaining (if broadly unoriginal) little film, but as someone NOT from the world of Saltburn - it left a sour taste.",emerald fennel posh person she extraordinari wealth take noth away achiev filmmak promis young woman terrif difficult watch rightli laud go know come side moral disturb parabl troubl set one irk meth two obviou antagonist type peopl youd typic root film rich v poor fact turn head doesnt feel like innov step feel like exact opposit feel like someon enorm privileg tri redress balanc almost like propaganda pieceit beauti shot realli well act solidli entertain broadli unorigin littl film someon world saltburn left sour tast,Negative
451,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching.",ye deriv ye even moder familiar movi last decad think talent mr ripley fairli earli runtim howev part enjoy barri keoghan never disappoint whether play suicid dullard banshe inisherin psychot mastermind movi mani role alway brilliantfor unfortun third act probabl memor featur requir enorm suspens disbelief rosamund elspeth charact invit keoghan oliv charact home yet even though histori unbeliev dubiou claim felt guilti exil one wonder motiv tri sex point rosamund pike ageless gorgeou woman charact endless wealthsh didnt need averagelook poor guy life also sign away fortun quickli suspici sudden ill life butler observ everyth ob remain presenc even elspeth took leav sen wouldnt interced third act defi sort logicbut worth watch,Positive
452,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
453,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

454,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

455,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart.

457,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

459,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes.

Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters.

466,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

469,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
470,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

471,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

473,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
474,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

475,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

476,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

477,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave!

478,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

479,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

480,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
482,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

484,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
485,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

490,I had greater expectations of this film given the combined talent of the cast. There are some very good actors in it but I suppose if the plot is no good there is nothing much they can do to elevate to watchable. Quick frankly it is barely watchable. Some really bizarre events occur that are neither funny nor scary. Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters. None of the characters including the leads are likeable. The plot is explained at the end but to be honest it's not worth watching to find out.,greater expect film given combin talent cast good actor suppos plot good noth much elev watchabl quick frankli bare watchabl realli bizarr event occur neither funni scari bewild film seemingli real stori plot interact rather superfici charact none charact includ lead likeabl plot explain end honest worth watch find,Positive
491,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

It's bold, provocative and just so funny, buoyed by a cast who completely understand the assignment and deliver glorious results.Barry Keoghan gives a fearless performance, bearing all in more ways than one. His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E.

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

494,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
495,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

496,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

498,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
499,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

500,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative

This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right.

504,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

505,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential.

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
507,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

509,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
510,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

516,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

519,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this.

520,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten. But it leaves a record of a decadent, nihilistic era that has been stripped of the basic values of humanity and civilization.",must observ saltburn vile disgust motion pictur charact unsympathet action abhorr bodili fluid flow throughout nauseat experienceth catton famili depict idl hedonist relic past deserv pick onebyon implic british aristocraci belong gutter beauti catton home includ detritu past shakespear first folio paint ruben discard along worn lord englandth middleclass also treat utter contempt young oliv appar asham famili inform friend father dead mother drunk parent proud son want lifeeven hallow hall univers oxford lost luster joy learn singl meet tutori even read book student read listthi film shortli forgotten leav record decad nihilist era strip basic valu human civil,Negative
521,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

523,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
524,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

525,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

526,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

527,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
528,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd.

529,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

530,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

532,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely.

534,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
535,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

541,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

544,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does.

545,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

546,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

548,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
549,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

550,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted. It's a solidly entertaining (if broadly unoriginal) little film, but as someone NOT from the world of Saltburn - it left a sour taste.",emerald fennel posh person she extraordinari wealth take noth away achiev filmmak promis young woman terrif difficult watch rightli laud go know come side moral disturb parabl troubl set one irk meth two obviou antagonist type peopl youd typic root film rich v poor fact turn head doesnt feel like innov step feel like exact opposit feel like someon enorm privileg tri redress balanc almost like propaganda pieceit beauti shot realli well act solidli entertain broadli unorigin littl film someon world saltburn left sour tast,Negative
551,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching.",ye deriv ye even moder familiar movi last decad think talent mr ripley fairli earli runtim howev part enjoy barri keoghan never disappoint whether play suicid dullard banshe inisherin psychot mastermind movi mani role alway brilliantfor unfortun third act probabl memor featur requir enorm suspens disbelief rosamund elspeth charact invit keoghan oliv charact home yet even though histori unbeliev dubiou claim felt guilti exil one wonder motiv tri sex point rosamund pike ageless gorgeou woman charact endless wealthsh didnt need averagelook poor guy life also sign away fortun quickli suspici sudden ill life butler observ everyth ob remain presenc even elspeth took leav sen wouldnt interced third act defi sort logicbut worth watch,Positive
552,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
553,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

554,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

555,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart.

557,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

559,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes.

Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

There are some very good actors in it but I suppose if the plot is no good there is nothing much they can do to elevate to watchable. Quick frankly it is barely watchable. Some really bizarre events occur that are neither funny nor scary. Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters.

566,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

569,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
570,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

571,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

573,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
574,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

575,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

576,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

577,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave!

578,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

579,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

580,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
582,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

584,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
585,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

590,I had greater expectations of this film given the combined talent of the cast. There are some very good actors in it but I suppose if the plot is no good there is nothing much they can do to elevate to watchable. Quick frankly it is barely watchable. Some really bizarre events occur that are neither funny nor scary. Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters. None of the characters including the leads are likeable. The plot is explained at the end but to be honest it's not worth watching to find out.,greater expect film given combin talent cast good actor suppos plot good noth much elev watchabl quick frankli bare watchabl realli bizarr event occur neither funni scari bewild film seemingli real stori plot interact rather superfici charact none charact includ lead likeabl plot explain end honest worth watch find,Positive
591,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

It's bold, provocative and just so funny, buoyed by a cast who completely understand the assignment and deliver glorious results.Barry Keoghan gives a fearless performance, bearing all in more ways than one. His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

594,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
595,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

596,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

598,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
599,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

600,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative

This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right.

604,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

605,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential.

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
607,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

609,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
610,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

616,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

619,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this.

620,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten. But it leaves a record of a decadent, nihilistic era that has been stripped of the basic values of humanity and civilization.",must observ saltburn vile disgust motion pictur charact unsympathet action abhorr bodili fluid flow throughout nauseat experienceth catton famili depict idl hedonist relic past deserv pick onebyon implic british aristocraci belong gutter beauti catton home includ detritu past shakespear first folio paint ruben discard along worn lord englandth middleclass also treat utter contempt young oliv appar asham famili inform friend father dead mother drunk parent proud son want lifeeven hallow hall univers oxford lost luster joy learn singl meet tutori even read book student read listthi film shortli forgotten leav record decad nihilist era strip basic valu human civil,Negative
621,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

623,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
624,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

625,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

626,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

627,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
628,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd.

629,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

630,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

632,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely.

634,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
635,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters.

641,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

644,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does.

645,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

646,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

648,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
649,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

650,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted. It's a solidly entertaining (if broadly unoriginal) little film, but as someone NOT from the world of Saltburn - it left a sour taste.",emerald fennel posh person she extraordinari wealth take noth away achiev filmmak promis young woman terrif difficult watch rightli laud go know come side moral disturb parabl troubl set one irk meth two obviou antagonist type peopl youd typic root film rich v poor fact turn head doesnt feel like innov step feel like exact opposit feel like someon enorm privileg tri redress balanc almost like propaganda pieceit beauti shot realli well act solidli entertain broadli unorigin littl film someon world saltburn left sour tast,Negative
651,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching.",ye deriv ye even moder familiar movi last decad think talent mr ripley fairli earli runtim howev part enjoy barri keoghan never disappoint whether play suicid dullard banshe inisherin psychot mastermind movi mani role alway brilliantfor unfortun third act probabl memor featur requir enorm suspens disbelief rosamund elspeth charact invit keoghan oliv charact home yet even though histori unbeliev dubiou claim felt guilti exil one wonder motiv tri sex point rosamund pike ageless gorgeou woman charact endless wealthsh didnt need averagelook poor guy life also sign away fortun quickli suspici sudden ill life butler observ everyth ob remain presenc even elspeth took leav sen wouldnt interced third act defi sort logicbut worth watch,Positive
652,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
653,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

654,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

655,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart.

657,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

659,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes.

Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

There are some very good actors in it but I suppose if the plot is no good there is nothing much they can do to elevate to watchable. Quick frankly it is barely watchable. Some really bizarre events occur that are neither funny nor scary. Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters.

666,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

669,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
670,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

671,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

When Felix tells Oliver that his father has died, Felix invites Oliver back to his family home, the grand mansion estate of Saltburn.Imagine coming from a humble background, and being dropped into a world of luxury and abundance, where aristocrats live their lives detached from reality.This had me captivated from start to finish, truly one of the most unique and original films that I've seen for some time.The trailer captivated me, I had high expectations, if I'm honest, it exceeded my expectations.

673,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
674,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

675,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

676,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

677,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave!

678,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

679,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

680,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
682,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

684,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
685,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

690,I had greater expectations of this film given the combined talent of the cast. There are some very good actors in it but I suppose if the plot is no good there is nothing much they can do to elevate to watchable. Quick frankly it is barely watchable. Some really bizarre events occur that are neither funny nor scary. Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters. None of the characters including the leads are likeable. The plot is explained at the end but to be honest it's not worth watching to find out.,greater expect film given combin talent cast good actor suppos plot good noth much elev watchabl quick frankli bare watchabl realli bizarr event occur neither funni scari bewild film seemingli real stori plot interact rather superfici charact none charact includ lead likeabl plot explain end honest worth watch find,Positive
691,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

It's bold, provocative and just so funny, buoyed by a cast who completely understand the assignment and deliver glorious results.Barry Keoghan gives a fearless performance, bearing all in more ways than one. His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

694,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
695,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

696,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

698,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
699,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

700,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative

This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right.

704,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

705,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential.

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
707,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

709,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
710,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

716,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

719,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this.

720,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

721,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

723,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
724,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

725,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

726,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

727,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
728,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it.

He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right.

729,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

730,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

732,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely.

734,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
735,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

741,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

744,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does.

745,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

746,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

748,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
749,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

750,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

751,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching.",ye deriv ye even moder familiar movi last decad think talent mr ripley fairli earli runtim howev part enjoy barri keoghan never disappoint whether play suicid dullard banshe inisherin psychot mastermind movi mani role alway brilliantfor unfortun third act probabl memor featur requir enorm suspens disbelief rosamund elspeth charact invit keoghan oliv charact home yet even though histori unbeliev dubiou claim felt guilti exil one wonder motiv tri sex point rosamund pike ageless gorgeou woman charact endless wealthsh didnt need averagelook poor guy life also sign away fortun quickli suspici sudden ill life butler observ everyth ob remain presenc even elspeth took leav sen wouldnt interced third act defi sort logicbut worth watch,Positive
752,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
753,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

754,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

755,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart.

757,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

759,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes.

Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters.

766,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

769,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
770,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

771,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

773,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
774,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

775,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

776,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

777,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave!

778,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

779,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

780,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
782,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

784,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
785,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

790,I had greater expectations of this film given the combined talent of the cast. There are some very good actors in it but I suppose if the plot is no good there is nothing much they can do to elevate to watchable. Quick frankly it is barely watchable. Some really bizarre events occur that are neither funny nor scary. Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters. None of the characters including the leads are likeable. The plot is explained at the end but to be honest it's not worth watching to find out.,greater expect film given combin talent cast good actor suppos plot good noth much elev watchabl quick frankli bare watchabl realli bizarr event occur neither funni scari bewild film seemingli real stori plot interact rather superfici charact none charact includ lead likeabl plot explain end honest worth watch find,Positive
791,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E.

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

794,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
795,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

796,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

798,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
799,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

800,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative

This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right.

804,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

805,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential.

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
807,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

809,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
810,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

816,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

819,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this.

820,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten. But it leaves a record of a decadent, nihilistic era that has been stripped of the basic values of humanity and civilization.",must observ saltburn vile disgust motion pictur charact unsympathet action abhorr bodili fluid flow throughout nauseat experienceth catton famili depict idl hedonist relic past deserv pick onebyon implic british aristocraci belong gutter beauti catton home includ detritu past shakespear first folio paint ruben discard along worn lord englandth middleclass also treat utter contempt young oliv appar asham famili inform friend father dead mother drunk parent proud son want lifeeven hallow hall univers oxford lost luster joy learn singl meet tutori even read book student read listthi film shortli forgotten leav record decad nihilist era strip basic valu human civil,Negative
821,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

823,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
824,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

825,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

826,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

827,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
828,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd.

829,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

830,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

832,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely.

834,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
835,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters.

841,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

844,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does.

845,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

846,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

848,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
849,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

850,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted. It's a solidly entertaining (if broadly unoriginal) little film, but as someone NOT from the world of Saltburn - it left a sour taste.",emerald fennel posh person she extraordinari wealth take noth away achiev filmmak promis young woman terrif difficult watch rightli laud go know come side moral disturb parabl troubl set one irk meth two obviou antagonist type peopl youd typic root film rich v poor fact turn head doesnt feel like innov step feel like exact opposit feel like someon enorm privileg tri redress balanc almost like propaganda pieceit beauti shot realli well act solidli entertain broadli unorigin littl film someon world saltburn left sour tast,Negative
851,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching.",ye deriv ye even moder familiar movi last decad think talent mr ripley fairli earli runtim howev part enjoy barri keoghan never disappoint whether play suicid dullard banshe inisherin psychot mastermind movi mani role alway brilliantfor unfortun third act probabl memor featur requir enorm suspens disbelief rosamund elspeth charact invit keoghan oliv charact home yet even though histori unbeliev dubiou claim felt guilti exil one wonder motiv tri sex point rosamund pike ageless gorgeou woman charact endless wealthsh didnt need averagelook poor guy life also sign away fortun quickli suspici sudden ill life butler observ everyth ob remain presenc even elspeth took leav sen wouldnt interced third act defi sort logicbut worth watch,Positive
852,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
853,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

854,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

855,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart.

857,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

859,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes.

Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

There are some very good actors in it but I suppose if the plot is no good there is nothing much they can do to elevate to watchable. Quick frankly it is barely watchable. Some really bizarre events occur that are neither funny nor scary. Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters.

866,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

869,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
870,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

871,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

When Felix tells Oliver that his father has died, Felix invites Oliver back to his family home, the grand mansion estate of Saltburn.Imagine coming from a humble background, and being dropped into a world of luxury and abundance, where aristocrats live their lives detached from reality.This had me captivated from start to finish, truly one of the most unique and original films that I've seen for some time.The trailer captivated me, I had high expectations, if I'm honest, it exceeded my expectations.

873,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
874,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

875,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

876,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

877,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave!

878,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

879,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

880,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive
881,"Take a bit of A Separate Peace, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Brideshead Revisited, Howards End and many more, mix them up into a rather incoherent story, and you get this over-the-top bit of fluff. The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
882,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

884,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
885,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

890,I had greater expectations of this film given the combined talent of the cast. There are some very good actors in it but I suppose if the plot is no good there is nothing much they can do to elevate to watchable. Quick frankly it is barely watchable. Some really bizarre events occur that are neither funny nor scary. Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters. None of the characters including the leads are likeable. The plot is explained at the end but to be honest it's not worth watching to find out.,greater expect film given combin talent cast good actor suppos plot good noth much elev watchabl quick frankli bare watchabl realli bizarr event occur neither funni scari bewild film seemingli real stori plot interact rather superfici charact none charact includ lead likeabl plot explain end honest worth watch find,Positive
891,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

It's bold, provocative and just so funny, buoyed by a cast who completely understand the assignment and deliver glorious results.Barry Keoghan gives a fearless performance, bearing all in more ways than one. His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

This is a self-indulgent, unoriginal, poke in the eye, middle finger to the viewers piece of shallow trash.There are no interesting characters, no interesting events, no moments of insight, nothing whatsoever to make it worth one's time to watch this drivel.It is derivative of several other more original and thoughtful films & stories. There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise. The writer director seems to go for pruerient, lame attempts to shock, but nothing - NOTHING - is unexpected, nothing is surprising.And, there are no sympathetic characters at all.

894,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
895,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

896,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

898,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
899,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

900,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
903,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it.

He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd.

904,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

905,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential.

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
907,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

909,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
910,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

916,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

919,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this.

920,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten. But it leaves a record of a decadent, nihilistic era that has been stripped of the basic values of humanity and civilization.",must observ saltburn vile disgust motion pictur charact unsympathet action abhorr bodili fluid flow throughout nauseat experienceth catton famili depict idl hedonist relic past deserv pick onebyon implic british aristocraci belong gutter beauti catton home includ detritu past shakespear first folio paint ruben discard along worn lord englandth middleclass also treat utter contempt young oliv appar asham famili inform friend father dead mother drunk parent proud son want lifeeven hallow hall univers oxford lost luster joy learn singl meet tutori even read book student read listthi film shortli forgotten leav record decad nihilist era strip basic valu human civil,Negative
921,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

923,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
924,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

925,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

926,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

927,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
928,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd.

929,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

930,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters.

932,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely.

934,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
935,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters.

941,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

944,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does.

945,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

946,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

948,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
949,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

950,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted. It's a solidly entertaining (if broadly unoriginal) little film, but as someone NOT from the world of Saltburn - it left a sour taste.",emerald fennel posh person she extraordinari wealth take noth away achiev filmmak promis young woman terrif difficult watch rightli laud go know come side moral disturb parabl troubl set one irk meth two obviou antagonist type peopl youd typic root film rich v poor fact turn head doesnt feel like innov step feel like exact opposit feel like someon enorm privileg tri redress balanc almost like propaganda pieceit beauti shot realli well act solidli entertain broadli unorigin littl film someon world saltburn left sour tast,Negative
951,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching.",ye deriv ye even moder familiar movi last decad think talent mr ripley fairli earli runtim howev part enjoy barri keoghan never disappoint whether play suicid dullard banshe inisherin psychot mastermind movi mani role alway brilliantfor unfortun third act probabl memor featur requir enorm suspens disbelief rosamund elspeth charact invit keoghan oliv charact home yet even though histori unbeliev dubiou claim felt guilti exil one wonder motiv tri sex point rosamund pike ageless gorgeou woman charact endless wealthsh didnt need averagelook poor guy life also sign away fortun quickli suspici sudden ill life butler observ everyth ob remain presenc even elspeth took leav sen wouldnt interced third act defi sort logicbut worth watch,Positive
952,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
953,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

954,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

955,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive
956,"Take a bit of A Separate Peace, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Brideshead Revisited, Howards End and many more, mix them up into a rather incoherent story, and you get this over-the-top bit of fluff. The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
957,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

959,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes.

Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

965,I had greater expectations of this film given the combined talent of the cast. There are some very good actors in it but I suppose if the plot is no good there is nothing much they can do to elevate to watchable. Quick frankly it is barely watchable. Some really bizarre events occur that are neither funny nor scary. Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters. None of the characters including the leads are likeable.

966,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

969,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
970,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

971,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

When Felix tells Oliver that his father has died, Felix invites Oliver back to his family home, the grand mansion estate of Saltburn.Imagine coming from a humble background, and being dropped into a world of luxury and abundance, where aristocrats live their lives detached from reality.This had me captivated from start to finish, truly one of the most unique and original films that I've seen for some time.The trailer captivated me, I had high expectations, if I'm honest, it exceeded my expectations.

973,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
974,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

975,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

976,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

977,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave!

978,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

979,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

980,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive
981,"Take a bit of A Separate Peace, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Brideshead Revisited, Howards End and many more, mix them up into a rather incoherent story, and you get this over-the-top bit of fluff. The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
982,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

984,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
985,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

990,I had greater expectations of this film given the combined talent of the cast. There are some very good actors in it but I suppose if the plot is no good there is nothing much they can do to elevate to watchable. Quick frankly it is barely watchable. Some really bizarre events occur that are neither funny nor scary. Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters. None of the characters including the leads are likeable. The plot is explained at the end but to be honest it's not worth watching to find out.,greater expect film given combin talent cast good actor suppos plot good noth much elev watchabl quick frankli bare watchabl realli bizarr event occur neither funni scari bewild film seemingli real stori plot interact rather superfici charact none charact includ lead likeabl plot explain end honest worth watch find,Positive
991,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

It's bold, provocative and just so funny, buoyed by a cast who completely understand the assignment and deliver glorious results.Barry Keoghan gives a fearless performance, bearing all in more ways than one. His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

993,"Baffled by the reviews here! This is a self-indulgent, unoriginal, poke in the eye, middle finger to the viewers piece of shallow trash.There are no interesting characters, no interesting events, no moments of insight, nothing whatsoever to make it worth one's time to watch this drivel.It is derivative of several other more original and thoughtful films & stories. There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise. The writer director seems to go for pruerient, lame attempts to shock, but nothing - NOTHING - is unexpected, nothing is surprising.And, there are no sympathetic characters at all.

994,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
995,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

996,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

998,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
999,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

1000,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative

He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd.

1004,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

1005,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential.

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
1007,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

1009,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
1010,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

1016,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

1019,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this.

1020,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten. But it leaves a record of a decadent, nihilistic era that has been stripped of the basic values of humanity and civilization.",must observ saltburn vile disgust motion pictur charact unsympathet action abhorr bodili fluid flow throughout nauseat experienceth catton famili depict idl hedonist relic past deserv pick onebyon implic british aristocraci belong gutter beauti catton home includ detritu past shakespear first folio paint ruben discard along worn lord englandth middleclass also treat utter contempt young oliv appar asham famili inform friend father dead mother drunk parent proud son want lifeeven hallow hall univers oxford lost luster joy learn singl meet tutori even read book student read listthi film shortli forgotten leav record decad nihilist era strip basic valu human civil,Negative
1021,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

1023,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
1024,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

1025,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

1026,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

1027,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
1028,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd.

1029,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

1030,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up.

There's no connection at all between the two major characters.

1032,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely.

1034,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
1035,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters.

1041,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

1044,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does.

1045,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

1046,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

1048,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
1049,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

1050,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted. It's a solidly entertaining (if broadly unoriginal) little film, but as someone NOT from the world of Saltburn - it left a sour taste.",emerald fennel posh person she extraordinari wealth take noth away achiev filmmak promis young woman terrif difficult watch rightli laud go know come side moral disturb parabl troubl set one irk meth two obviou antagonist type peopl youd typic root film rich v poor fact turn head doesnt feel like innov step feel like exact opposit feel like someon enorm privileg tri redress balanc almost like propaganda pieceit beauti shot realli well act solidli entertain broadli unorigin littl film someon world saltburn left sour tast,Negative
1051,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching.",ye deriv ye even moder familiar movi last decad think talent mr ripley fairli earli runtim howev part enjoy barri keoghan never disappoint whether play suicid dullard banshe inisherin psychot mastermind movi mani role alway brilliantfor unfortun third act probabl memor featur requir enorm suspens disbelief rosamund elspeth charact invit keoghan oliv charact home yet even though histori unbeliev dubiou claim felt guilti exil one wonder motiv tri sex point rosamund pike ageless gorgeou woman charact endless wealthsh didnt need averagelook poor guy life also sign away fortun quickli suspici sudden ill life butler observ everyth ob remain presenc even elspeth took leav sen wouldnt interced third act defi sort logicbut worth watch,Positive
1052,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
1053,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

1054,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

1055,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart.

1057,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

1059,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes.

Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

There are some very good actors in it but I suppose if the plot is no good there is nothing much they can do to elevate to watchable. Quick frankly it is barely watchable. Some really bizarre events occur that are neither funny nor scary. Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters. None of the characters including the leads are likeable.

1066,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

1069,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
1070,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

1071,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

1073,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
1074,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

1075,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

1076,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

1077,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave!

1078,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

1079,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

1080,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive
1081,"Take a bit of A Separate Peace, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Brideshead Revisited, Howards End and many more, mix them up into a rather incoherent story, and you get this over-the-top bit of fluff. The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
1082,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

1084,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
1085,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

1090,I had greater expectations of this film given the combined talent of the cast. There are some very good actors in it but I suppose if the plot is no good there is nothing much they can do to elevate to watchable. Quick frankly it is barely watchable. Some really bizarre events occur that are neither funny nor scary. Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters. None of the characters including the leads are likeable. The plot is explained at the end but to be honest it's not worth watching to find out.,greater expect film given combin talent cast good actor suppos plot good noth much elev watchabl quick frankli bare watchabl realli bizarr event occur neither funni scari bewild film seemingli real stori plot interact rather superfici charact none charact includ lead likeabl plot explain end honest worth watch find,Positive
1091,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

It's bold, provocative and just so funny, buoyed by a cast who completely understand the assignment and deliver glorious results.Barry Keoghan gives a fearless performance, bearing all in more ways than one. His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise. The writer director seems to go for pruerient, lame attempts to shock, but nothing - NOTHING - is unexpected, nothing is surprising.And, there are no sympathetic characters at all.

1094,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
1095,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

1096,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

1098,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
1099,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

1100,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative

This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right.

1104,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

1105,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts.

1106,"Take a bit of A Separate Peace, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Brideshead Revisited, Howards End and many more, mix them up into a rather incoherent story, and you get this over-the-top bit of fluff. The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
1107,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

1109,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
1110,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

1116,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

1119,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this.

1120,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten. But it leaves a record of a decadent, nihilistic era that has been stripped of the basic values of humanity and civilization.",must observ saltburn vile disgust motion pictur charact unsympathet action abhorr bodili fluid flow throughout nauseat experienceth catton famili depict idl hedonist relic past deserv pick onebyon implic british aristocraci belong gutter beauti catton home includ detritu past shakespear first folio paint ruben discard along worn lord englandth middleclass also treat utter contempt young oliv appar asham famili inform friend father dead mother drunk parent proud son want lifeeven hallow hall univers oxford lost luster joy learn singl meet tutori even read book student read listthi film shortli forgotten leav record decad nihilist era strip basic valu human civil,Negative
1121,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

1123,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
1124,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

1125,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

1127,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
1128,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it.

He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right.

1129,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

1130,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential.

1132,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely.

1134,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
1135,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

1141,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

1144,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does.

1145,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

1146,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

1148,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
1149,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

1150,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted. It's a solidly entertaining (if broadly unoriginal) little film, but as someone NOT from the world of Saltburn - it left a sour taste.",emerald fennel posh person she extraordinari wealth take noth away achiev filmmak promis young woman terrif difficult watch rightli laud go know come side moral disturb parabl troubl set one irk meth two obviou antagonist type peopl youd typic root film rich v poor fact turn head doesnt feel like innov step feel like exact opposit feel like someon enorm privileg tri redress balanc almost like propaganda pieceit beauti shot realli well act solidli entertain broadli unorigin littl film someon world saltburn left sour tast,Negative
1151,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching.",ye deriv ye even moder familiar movi last decad think talent mr ripley fairli earli runtim howev part enjoy barri keoghan never disappoint whether play suicid dullard banshe inisherin psychot mastermind movi mani role alway brilliantfor unfortun third act probabl memor featur requir enorm suspens disbelief rosamund elspeth charact invit keoghan oliv charact home yet even though histori unbeliev dubiou claim felt guilti exil one wonder motiv tri sex point rosamund pike ageless gorgeou woman charact endless wealthsh didnt need averagelook poor guy life also sign away fortun quickli suspici sudden ill life butler observ everyth ob remain presenc even elspeth took leav sen wouldnt interced third act defi sort logicbut worth watch,Positive
1152,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
1153,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

1154,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

1155,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart.

1157,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

1159,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes.

Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters.

1166,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E.

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise.

1169,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
1170,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

1171,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

1173,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
1174,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

1175,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

1176,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

1177,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave!

1178,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it. THAT'S why he fixates on Felix (the 'happy'), recognising him for who he is. He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right. Several different movies and plotlines, and at the end it's an uninteresting mess.We are introduced to Oliver as a too straight nerd who wants to be part of the in-crowd. Okay, so we tag along, even believing that Felix likes him (because he's not a fanboy).As soon as we get to Saltburn the film loses credibility.

1179,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

1180,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive
1181,"Take a bit of A Separate Peace, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Brideshead Revisited, Howards End and many more, mix them up into a rather incoherent story, and you get this over-the-top bit of fluff. The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
1182,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

1184,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
1185,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

1190,I had greater expectations of this film given the combined talent of the cast. There are some very good actors in it but I suppose if the plot is no good there is nothing much they can do to elevate to watchable. Quick frankly it is barely watchable. Some really bizarre events occur that are neither funny nor scary. Just bewildering as for most of the film there is seemingly no real story or plot just interactions between some rather superficial characters. None of the characters including the leads are likeable. The plot is explained at the end but to be honest it's not worth watching to find out.,greater expect film given combin talent cast good actor suppos plot good noth much elev watchabl quick frankli bare watchabl realli bizarr event occur neither funni scari bewild film seemingli real stori plot interact rather superfici charact none charact includ lead likeabl plot explain end honest worth watch find,Positive
1191,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive
1192,"Emerald Fennell leaps over any potential sophomore slumps with Saltburn, an immensely twisted tale of obsession and excess that's black comedy eventually goes into much darker territory. It's bold, provocative and just so funny, buoyed by a cast who completely understand the assignment and deliver glorious results.Barry Keoghan gives a fearless performance, bearing all in more ways than one. His character is so fascinating, initially an audience surrogate that could've felt overly safe but his constant weaving in and out of control is a real highlight, making him so much more interesting and flawed.Jacob Elordi is enchanting, he's so kind without a single care in the world and one of the few seemingly nice people in Saltburn though not without his own self obsessed flaws. Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant dial it up to eleven and get some of the best laughs.Emerald Fennell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren craft a gorgeous film of vivid saturation and striking imagery (some of which cannot be unseen).

There is almost no story here, actually. It is just little scenes of shallowness, one after the other. There are no surprises. The reveal at the end is completely devoid of surprise. The writer director seems to go for pruerient, lame attempts to shock, but nothing - NOTHING - is unexpected, nothing is surprising.And, there are no sympathetic characters at all.

1194,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this. As has also been much discussed Keoghan does have a rather extensive nude sequence. Besides the nudity, which he has nothing to be ashamed of, I'm not sure what to make of this scene. I can understand its existence, but I'm a little unclear as to why he sashays through it in the manner that he does. This is Emerald Fennell's second film as a director and while it hasn't received the acclaim of the first, Promising Young Woman, I did enjoy this more.",anxiou see film due presenc barri keoghan found fascin kill sacr deer immens entertain banshe inisherin howev one thing wasnt expect see erot role erotic name game play boldli well put mildli that good thing front center time knew one lead didnt know much role domin film ive view twice truli excel play innoc backward funni sexi mysteri sli vile evil equal well presenc perform fortun film offer noth terribl origin purpl noonmr ripley scenario though write witti smart noth wrong rest cast either dont role like object ador play jacob elordi good job rosamund pike archi madekw carey mulligan small extrem funni role much discus coupl rather outrag scene might upset easili perhap even easili offend might want avoid also much discus keoghan rather extens nude sequenc besid nuditi noth asham im sure make scene understand exist im littl unclear sashay manner emerald fennel second film director hasnt receiv acclaim first promis young woman enjoy,Positive
1195,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten.

1196,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

1198,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
1199,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

1200,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative

This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right.

1204,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

1205,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts.

1206,"Take a bit of A Separate Peace, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Brideshead Revisited, Howards End and many more, mix them up into a rather incoherent story, and you get this over-the-top bit of fluff. The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.",take bit separ peac talent mr ripley brideshead revisit howard end mani mix rather incoher stori get overthetop bit fluff problem numer mention glare there tad credibl setup stori involv someon one class mix someon anoth must show there connect two peopl part complet skip there connect two major charact bond never explainedthen there issu charact one film real person pawn serv grand plot dissect fall apart arent peopl theyr vehicl screenwrit director produc etc show interest ultim flaw storyso much el wrong movi give away would contain spoiler review worthwhil imdb one warn reader showconsid warn,Positive
1207,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.",scholarship student oliv quick arriv oxford doesnt fit upperclass atmospher acquaint befriend felix catton popular wealthi fellow student howev oliv final seem find place univers invit catton famili home saltburn summer holiday oliv thrust dark heart blue blood noth seem though idyl vacat transform one hell itselfwritten direct emerald fennel saltburn initi intrigu though ultim irritatingli deriv predict psycholog comichorror fennel narr begin promis first act arent sure trust stori head howev action move manor hous saltburn thing devolv messi obviou retread idea express eloqu previou film talent mr ripley teorema servantthos film examin theme class differ ob person manipul aplomb ingenu fennel appear content skirt around edg theme never go depth charact narr provid kind motiv action one particular act violent vacuum selfobsess jealous made charact way fennel never bother tell u seem satisfi leav audienc darkmoreov character larg base stereotyp clich oliv essenti le charismat scous tom ripley dark beneath thin veneer awkward shyness felix exactli like ripley object ob dicki greenleaf eccentr famili peopl weve seen countless film mock aristocraci rule class among familiar lack depth fennel charact arent particularli interest narr particularli origin dialogu frequent funni also pretenti particularli oliv intermitt narrationthroughout film fennel handl materi great defer much one might argu let uncomfort scene linger intermin seem think imbu kind raw power end featur fullfront nuditi reminisc music video liam gallagh star thank cloth eric cantona seem selfindulg shall say cocki furthermor twist last act neither surpris effect also send film realm fantasi complet abandon realworld logicconvers linu sandgren glossi cinematographi strike sandgren make excel use colour unconvent shot angl heighten suspens narr well compound decad catton famili employ ratio give film topheavi boxedin look make locat feel daunt work full contrast although cynic critic might suggest overreli clich visual metaphor reflect obviou juxtaposit charact wear devil horn angel wingshowev sandgren visual gener come boon proceed suzi davi rich product design textur detail work foster vivid immers atmospher sophi canal costum design charlott dirickx set decor compound addit anthoni willis score stir origin piec seedi evoc song use throughout perhap notabl sophi ellisbextor murder dancefloor complement narrativebarri keoghan star oliv alongsid jacob elordi felix alison oliv felix sister venetia rosamund pike felix mother elspeth keoghan fascin actor play strang charact verv intellig howev give inconsist perform play oliv weird insular person shine though display domin side keoghan lack convict doesnt convinc oddli play oddli written nighttim scene venetia clearest evid thiselordi much assur work despit fact charact version aforement greenleaf impress though overcom scant characteris role oliv excel underplay complex charact pike steal show eccentr elspeth richard e grant also star felix father crimin underutilis archi madekw grate perform felix cousin smug onenotein conclus emerald fennel saltburn film tri provok though isnt challeng origin creator think though funni time time first act intrigu suspens film ultim uneven predict deriv affair cinematographi strike score atmospher perform star barri keoghan inconsist although rosamund pike delight film around worthi talent save complet rub salt wound film doesnt burn brightli could,Positive

1209,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
1210,"Scouser student Oliver (Barry Keoghan, who is not English but Irish) arrives at Oxford University where he sticks out like a sore thumb (""he's a scholarship boy and buys his clothes from Oxfam"" sniffs one plummy-voiced deb). Despite this he attracts the attention of Home Counties aristocrat Felix (Jacob Elordi, who is not English but Australian/Spanish) who takes him to his family's country pile - the titular stately home - where Oliver meets Felix's family of stereotypical English aristos: vague mother, mad father, nymphomanic sister, American cousin (Archie Madekwe, who is not American but English/Nigerian/Swiss). At first even more out-of-place than he was at Oxford, Oliver quickly becomes used to life at Saltburn. But for how long will he be welcome there?Watching this at the 2023 London Film Festival, I found it reminded me of various other films: the obvious one is 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999), but there are also aspects of 'Wild Things' (1998) and 'The Riot Club' (2014). Despite this, 'Saltburn' does stand on its own two feet, principally because Oliver's motives are ambiguous and, unlike 'Ripley', there is a vein of comedy throughout (sometimes unintentionally: a scene of Oliver drinking bathwater into which Felix has just ejaculated had the audience falling about, but I am not sure that was the intention of writer/director/producer Emerald Fennell!) I also appreciated that Fennell avoids the reverse-discrimination trap of making rich folk exclusively nasty but instead shows that - hey! - aristocrats have feelings too! Felix, especially, is sympathetically-drawn. If I have any criticism it is that at over two hours the film is over-long - after the birthday party sequence it seems the film has reached a natural conclusion, although there is, it turns out, good reason for it to carry on... perhaps a few of the mid-way scenes could have been cut.The supporting players are gifted with enjoyable parts - standouts are Carey Mulligan as a drug-addled socialite and Paul Rhys (who, thirty years ago, would have been a natural to play Oliver) as a straight-laced butler. Those actors essaying accents not their own do a good job - Elordi's rich-boy drawl, in particular, is convincing. And as for leading man Keoghan - the lengthy sequence during which he dances nude to 'Murder on the Dance Floor' is likely to be one of the most-discussed scenes of the film.",scouser student oliv barri keoghan english irish arriv oxford univers stick like sore thumb he scholarship boy buy cloth oxfam sniff one plummyvo deb despit attract attent home counti aristocrat felix jacob elordi english australianspanish take famili countri pile titular state home oliv meet felix famili stereotyp english aristo vagu mother mad father nymphoman sister american cousin archi madekw american englishnigerianswiss first even outofplac oxford oliv quickli becom use life saltburn long welcom therewatch london film festiv found remind variou film obviou one talent mr ripley also aspect wild thing riot club despit saltburn stand two foot princip oliv motiv ambigu unlik ripley vein comedi throughout sometim unintent scene oliv drink bathwat felix ejacul audienc fall sure intent writerdirectorproduc emerald fennel also appreci fennel avoid reversediscrimin trap make rich folk exclus nasti instead show hey aristocrat feel felix especi sympatheticallydrawn critic two hour film overlong birthday parti sequenc seem film reach natur conclus although turn good reason carri perhap midway scene could cutth support player gift enjoy part standout carey mulligan drugaddl socialit paul rhi thirti year ago would natur play oliv straightlac butler actor essay accent good job elordi richboy drawl particular convinc lead man keoghan lengthi sequenc danc nude murder danc floor like one mostdiscuss scene film,Positive

1216,"One has to assume 'Saltburn' was conceived as subversive satire or parody, but it's difficult to discern which it might be, since it possesses minimal sarcasm and humor. The copycat plot is derived from several sources - it initially follows the 'Brideshead Revisited' blueprint, relating how socially-challenged working class undergraduate Oliver Quick becomes friends with upper crust fellow collegian Felix at Oxford University. After a fairly shallow acquaintance, he's invited to spend the summer vacation with the latter's family at their stately home, Saltburn.The invitation is a mystery since Oliver is devoid of wit or allure, and upon arrival he's treated with universal condescension. The aristocratic clan are portrayed as eccentrics who would fit more comfortably in a farce - and they seem especially out of place when the story gallops off towards the territory of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' and 'Talented Mr Ripley'. Oliver suddenly transforms from awkward dork into master manipulator - and it's another mystery how he accomplishes this, since he has no means to influence anybody. The other characters lack credibility in a similar way - and since everyone is tiresome and unpleasant, it's hard to maintain interest as the shadows deepen. Despite attempts to shock with some gratuitously distasteful episodes - concluding with a muddy bout of virtual necrophilia - this protracted tale becomes tedious long before its end.",one assum saltburn conceiv subvers satir parodi difficult discern might sinc posse minim sarcasm humor copycat plot deriv sever sourc initi follow brideshead revisit blueprint relat sociallychalleng work class undergradu oliv quick becom friend upper crust fellow collegian felix oxford univers fairli shallow acquaint he invit spend summer vacat latter famili state home saltburnth invit mysteri sinc oliv devoid wit allur upon arriv he treat univers condescens aristocrat clan portray eccentr would fit comfort farc seem especi place stori gallop toward territori kind heart coronet talent mr ripley oliv suddenli transform awkward dork master manipul anoth mysteri accomplish sinc mean influenc anybodi charact lack credibl similar way sinc everyon tiresom unpleas hard maintain interest shadow deepen despit attempt shock gratuit distast episod conclud muddi bout virtual necrophilia protract tale becom tediou long end,Positive

1219,"I had been anxious to see this film due to the presence of Barry Keoghan as I found him fascinating in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and immensely entertaining in The Banshees of Inisherin, however the one thing I wasn't expecting was to see him in such an erotic role, but eroticism is the name of the game here and he plays it boldly and very well, to put it mildly. That's a good thing as he is front and center and in between at all times. I knew he was one of the leads in this, but I didn't know how much his role dominated the film. I've viewed this twice now and he is truly excellent. He plays innocent, backwards, funny, sexy, mysterious, sly, vile and evil all equally well. His presence and his performance is very fortunate as the film itself offers nothing terribly original in this Purple Noon/Mr. Ripley scenario, though the writing is witty and smart and there is nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either. They just don't have roles like he does! The object of his adoration is played by Jacob Elordi who does a good job here as does Rosamund Pike, Archie Madekwe and Carey Mulligan is a small, extremely funny role. As has been much discussed this does have a couple of rather outrageous scenes that might be upsetting to some, so those easily, or perhaps even those not so easily offended, might want to avoid this.

1220,"It must be observed that ""Saltburn"" is a vile and disgusting motion picture. The characters are unsympathetic, and their actions abhorrent with the bodily fluids flowing throughout this nauseating experience.The Catton family is depicted as an idle, hedonistic relic of the past that deserves to be picked off one-by-one with the implication that the British aristocracy belongs in the gutter. The beautiful Catton home includes detritus from the past such as Shakespeare's First Folio and paintings of Rubens that should be discarded along with the worn out Lords of England.The middle-class is also treated with utter contempt, as young Oliver is apparently so ashamed of his family that he informs his friends that his father is dead and is mother is a drunk. The parents are proud of their son. He wants them out of his life.Even the hallowed halls of The University of Oxford have lost any luster of the joy of learning. The single don that we meet in a tutorial has not even read the books on the students' reading list.This film will shortly be forgotten. But it leaves a record of a decadent, nihilistic era that has been stripped of the basic values of humanity and civilization.",must observ saltburn vile disgust motion pictur charact unsympathet action abhorr bodili fluid flow throughout nauseat experienceth catton famili depict idl hedonist relic past deserv pick onebyon implic british aristocraci belong gutter beauti catton home includ detritu past shakespear first folio paint ruben discard along worn lord englandth middleclass also treat utter contempt young oliv appar asham famili inform friend father dead mother drunk parent proud son want lifeeven hallow hall univers oxford lost luster joy learn singl meet tutori even read book student read listthi film shortli forgotten leav record decad nihilist era strip basic valu human civil,Negative
1221,"I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of ""Another Country"" meets ""Brideshead Revisited"" as the story of ""Ollie"" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal ""Felix"" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",quit nervou saw expect sort hybrid anoth countri meet brideshead revisit stori olli barri keoghan aristocrat pal felix jacob elordi unfold oxford univers former man much poor relat wellheel contemporari one afternoon though come aid felix lend bike ensu friendship see two gradual start bond latter invit new friend eponym state pile guest mother rosamund pike father richard e grant tag along throughout experi slightli malevol jealou farleigh archi madekw summer vacil hedonist enjoy ghastli tragic bit slow starter arriv ancestr pile stori start gather pace olli prove quit adept navig even manipul frequent quit treacher environ find definit dialogu heavi keoghan good quit effect build degre menac start realis mayb thing arent quit seem found madekw also rather good odiou hangeron posher one carey mulligan walk quit charact tightrop photographi aesthet film along anthoni willis score add degre rich stori isnt deriv fear cant think film rememb year well worth watch mr keoghan continu journey must greater success,Positive

1223,"They say write what you know. What I know is this is perhaps the most ironic film I've ever seen. Many people may not know the director Emerald Fennell comes from a very wealthy family, went to private school her entire life (including Oxford), and got her start due to those private school connections. To watch her send up upper class privilege as grotesque and distorted is bizarre in its own right but even more bizzare is she is selling her satire for money.The movie itself feels like a giant trope, more characature than human and almost cliche in its representation of money as all encompassing and all corrupting. My only theory is this film is mainly an apology from Fennell, trying to convince us she's one of the ""good"" privileged people for sending up the world she was raised in. But then I remember she's enriching herself by making this film, selling privilege to beget more privilege.If there was an award for ironic film of the year, this would win hands down.",say write know know perhap iron film ive ever seen mani peopl may know director emerald fennel come wealthi famili went privat school entir life includ oxford got start due privat school connect watch send upper class privileg grotesqu distort bizarr right even bizzar sell satir moneyth movi feel like giant trope characatur human almost clich represent money encompass corrupt theori film mainli apolog fennel tri convinc u she one good privileg peopl send world rais rememb she enrich make film sell privileg beget privilegeif award iron film year would win hand,Positive
1224,"I liked Emerald Fennell's first feature, A Promising Young Woman, although it was a little left field and a touch disturbing. In this movie, she ramps up the disturbing with many scenes of repulsive behaviour which feel way too gratuitous - if the British aristocracy is really like this, the country is screwed.The plot is essentially that of A Talented Mr Ripley but the script is nowhere near as good and the narrative is often disjointed and at times boring. The directorial style is dark and gothic, but a bit inconsistent - some scenes are too long, some are pointless and the whole movie could have been 20-30 minutes shorter.There's occasional humour but it's offset by the depravity, which is really overdone. The acting is excellent however - Barry Keoghan plays the main character to perfection as an allegedly poor and lonely soul at Oxford who is desperate for the friendship of the handsome, popular and rich son of an eccentric aristocrat family. Rosamund Pike is also superb as the matriarch. A cameo by Carey Mulligan however is a complete waste of her talents.The plot twist towards the end was somewhat predictable so hardly a shock for a movie trying to sporadically shock you with depraved behaviour mixed in with efforts to parody the British upper class - but with not much class.If you like pretentious Arthouse films designed to shock the senses and you don't mind the disjointed script, then this movie might well be for you.

1225,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite. It feels like someone from enormous privilege trying to redress the balance, almost like a propaganda piece.It's beautifully shot. It's really well acted.

1226,"Yes, it's derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamund's Elspeth character invites Keoghan's Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth--she didn't need an average-looking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldn't he intercede?

1227,"There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I can't fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The 'not for the feint hearted' stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film.",lot hype movi lot talk scene feint heart full twist turn lure wrong reason knew littl el saltburn sat watch itmi score entir cast cant fault sadli posit draw aw filmth twist saw come heavili contriv none felt shock slightestth feint heart stuff suck ejacul drain bath plug eat menstrual blood sex recent fill grave gratuit shock valu yet without scene liter noth el go onsaltburn serious dull watch humour bare present would turn hour got far stay hope clever end noth clever fact rather clever went nonsens one would suspect new guy would behind death could get hand estatebor journey weak plot dull twist gratuit scene make good watch cast film,Negative
1228,"I was willing to get involved in the story, but there was no story, just stuff happening, most of it unexplained, most of it silly and ridiculous, not shocking at all, just boring.I rewrote it in my head to make it make a little more sense, as the crumbs we are told and shown have so many holes they're sieves.He read about Saltburn, saw pictures, wanted to go there, yes, maybe already making plans to own it.

He wants to BE him, that's what the silly sexual stuff is about, unification, amalgamation with the desired natural born status, looks, etc.Thing is, this was all nothing. This was not a film about a psychopath, because that is shown in a 30 second collage towards the end, motivation never explained. Are we supposed to think it's jealousy? Bit lame. All we got up to that point is that he is a manipulator and a liar. The 'twist' is neither surprising nor shocking, it just takes you completely out of the film, because it's not gelled right.

1229,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do.

1230,"Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.",saltburn direct emerald fennel brought u excel promis young woman psycholog thriller drama attempt navig mazelik world english aristocraci unfortun lose way film star barri keoghan oliv quick scholarship student oxford univers jacob elordi felix catton charm aristocrat invit oliv spend summer famili sprawl estat saltburnsaltburn set mid period mark econom cultur decad attempt explor clash social class moral vacuiti seduct wealth howev film histor cultur context feel superfici fail delv deepli societ dynam time despit promis plot suffer predict lack subtleti film tri play idea enorm bastion privileg power uniqu breed ground strang doesnt quit hit mark forc repetit dialogu frequent feel artifici contriv weaken narrativedespit talent actor portray charact lack depth oliv play keoghan hate lust enviou charact portray flat uncompl felix play elordi charact come life blatant privileg flimsi compass seem realalthough fennel direct bold lack dexter requir make intric stori come life film pace errat certain scene seem rush other drag needlessli movi soundtrack seem haphazard improv stori movi also occasion goe bit far term tast may cringingth cinematographi product design perhap film strongest point grandeur saltburn sprawl estat captur beauti film commend job creat livedin feel feel glamor filthi time artist compon howev insuffici make film weak narrativesaltburn film promis much deliv littl despit grand set talent cast fail provid compel narr engag charact film tri critiqu english aristocraci psycholog thriller fall short count may appeal viewer aesthet appeal film unfortun doesnt live potenti film id recommend,Positive

1232,"It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely.

1233,"Other reviewers use the word ""derivative"" a lot to describe this film. They're not wrong! And my God this is a tedious film to try to get through! The so-called twist at the end is anything but. There's absolutely no reward at the end for sticking with this grotesque and uninteresting film. The suspenseful bits aren't suspenseful. The funny bits aren't funny and the sexy bits aren't sexy. The only thing the film maker succeeded at was making the grotesque parts nauseatingly grotesque. There's not one interesting nor sympathetic character in the bunch. There's no reason to care about what happens to any of them! A complete waste of time!",review use word deriv lot describ film theyr wrong god tediou film tri get socal twist end anyth there absolut reward end stick grotesqu uninterest film suspens bit arent suspens funni bit arent funni sexi bit arent sexi thing film maker succeed make grotesqu part nauseatingli grotesqu there one interest sympathet charact bunch there reason care happen complet wast time,Positive
1234,"Just Got out of a Packed Saltburn Screening.WARNING 🚫🛀 - This Film Has Multiple Nasty Moments . There were Multiple Gasps and Audible ""oh god"" moments from the Audience 👅😳Quick Side Note - I have no Problems with this Script and Twist, but looking back, it's just not executed very well due to the lack of development, actions and dialogue prior to the Closing of the Film.So, Positives First -1. 🦇 The Gothic Production Design was Outstanding, Coupled with the Cinematography, Some Great Camera Work and there were Several Gorgeous Shots. That Scene with Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) Walking Towards Venetia and it had almost a Blue Tint to it was Outstanding. That Particular Scene had this Strong Gothic Vibe to it.2. 🎾 The Performances were Good Across the Board, Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Richard E Grant, all Good. Rosamund Pike was Exceptionally Good.3. 😆 Many of the Comedic Moments worked and had parts of the audience laughing and 1 particular Joke Got a Belly Laugh out of the Audience ""It was all too Wet"" - by Rosamund Pike 😂🤣4. I loved the Funeral Scene with the ""Butler Knows who did it, Stare from afar"" Scene. (The Writer did a little spin on the Butler did it😏)On to the NegativesNegatives -1. 🚩One of the Main Problems I have with this Film, is I didn't really buy Barry Keoghans' Character(Oliver) being Infatuated(in a normal way, not the Gross out Stuff) with Jacob Elordis' Character(Felix). It just didn't come across on screen that way.2. 🚩But you're probably saying, ""But, he never really loved him anyway, so who cares?"" Ok, so he hated him right? So why is he Drinking His Juice out of the Bathtub🛁😳 and Laying (and that's Putting it nicely) on top of his Grave? So is Oliver Mentally ill? But he seemed to have come from a somewhat stable household. 🙇🤷3. 🚩Another big Problem with the film is that, what is Olivers Motivation? Did he want the Money & Lifestyle? Did he want to Punish this Family? What Exactly did he want? The Plotline does need subtlety yes, but for this particular point, it needs to have a motivation. By the End, The Film doesn't really Convey this. It's all Confusion. 😕4. 🚩The Supposed Danger of Oliver Having an Affair with Rosamund Pikes' character(Elsbeth) was not there at all. A compliment here and there is not enough. On top of that, they could of done more with this angle.5. Moreover, the way in which Oliver Embedded himself into the Family, wasn't done that well.6. For me, when a Certain Character Dies and the Subsequent Scenes after His Death. The Film Just sort of fell apart (for me). It went from Build, Build, Build, ""Ok this is Ok, were building towards something"", then the Death Happens and then some scenes happen and then I thought to myself ""Sigh, the films Level just went down 1 or 2 Levels""😔7. 🤦🏻 Near The Very Ending with the Montage ""of Events"" was just not the way to Do That. Don't Give us everything in the Span of 5 Minutes. The Writer of this Film needed to keep those points more Subtle and ambiguous, so we can think about it after we've left the Cinema and say ""oh yeah, that's why he did this & that.....""Overall, I Loved the Production Design and Cinematography but Some of the Character Development and Motivations were Lacking and the Plotline lacked Subtlety when it needed it, and also Lacked Emphasis when it needed it.",got pack saltburn screeningwarn 🚫🛀 film multipl nasti moment multipl gasp audibl oh god moment audienc 👅😳quick side note problem script twist look back execut well due lack develop action dialogu prior close filmso posit first 🦇 gothic product design outstand coupl cinematographi great camera work sever gorgeou shot scene barri keoghan characteroliv walk toward venetia almost blue tint outstand particular scene strong gothic vibe 🎾 perform good across board barri keoghan jacob elordi alison oliv archi madekw richard e grant good rosamund pike except good 😆 mani comed moment work part audienc laugh particular joke got belli laugh audienc wet rosamund pike 😂🤣 love funer scene butler know stare afar scene writer littl spin butler it😏on negativesneg 🚩one main problem film didnt realli buy barri keoghan characteroliv infatuatedin normal way gross stuff jacob elordi characterfelix didnt come across screen way 🚩but your probabl say never realli love anyway care ok hate right drink juic bathtub🛁😳 lay that put nice top grave oliv mental ill seem come somewhat stabl household 🙇🤷 🚩anoth big problem film oliv motiv want money lifestyl want punish famili exactli want plotlin need subtleti ye particular point need motiv end film doesnt realli convey confus 😕 🚩the suppos danger oliv affair rosamund pike characterelsbeth compliment enough top could done angl moreov way oliv embed famili wasnt done well certain charact die subsequ scene death film sort fell apart went build build build ok ok build toward someth death happen scene happen thought sigh film level went levels😔 🤦🏻 near end montag event way dont give u everyth span minut writer film need keep point subtl ambigu think weve left cinema say oh yeah that thatoveral love product design cinematographi charact develop motiv lack plotlin lack subtleti need also lack emphasi need,Positive
